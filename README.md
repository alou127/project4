Let me paint a scenario, you walk into a Macy's or Sephora, and see the glowing wall of perfumes and colognes. You pick one up, spray it on a test strip, and end up loving the scent! But, what does it smell like? How do you articulate the scent into words? Well, you could look up the bottle on the website and get a discription of what you like. With this discription, you would have to comb through the website to find another bottle for a similar scent. This would be SUPER INEFFICENT.

What if instead, there was a kiosk with an app that allowed you to type in the bottle of perfume and it would recommend you:

- other perfumes with similar characteristics
- similar perfumes that are cheaper
- or maybe a similar profile perfume/cologne for your partner

This would surely increase customer satisfaction when it comes to shopping for fragrance gifts for the customer and their friends and family.

This could be achieved by scraping perfume/cologne descriptions from Macys/Sephora's website and using NLP to help bin certain fragrences together with a unsupervised machine learning algorithm such as K-means.
